# Digit-recognition-NUMPY-

This contains 2 files one which trains the model on the MSE loss and is backpropagated using pure math 
all activations are also from scratch the model is trained on the  MNIST dataset  and the  results are 
stored in np files, this was done such that I would understand the flowthrough of a neural net and how
it works...

The model isnt perfect it can be trained to decrease loss and increase overall accur but whenever
tested in real world environments using the MODEL TESTER the output is the worst possible outcome
it could be as of overfitting or no data augmentation or some mistake in the code, will update at 
the time of figuring out the problem....
